## Description
These creatures operate at the cosmic scale within the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Simple-minded and operating wholly on instinct, they are the progenitors of life on all planets as is a direct result of the nature of their own lifecycle. They harbor no capacity for maliciousness, only the guiding instinct to find stars, lay eggs, and to use their very fine [Baleen](Baleen - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen) to consume various elements found within the dust of space.

Their bodies are whale-like in appearance with a crystalline mesh of scales covering them. Relatively small and underdeveloped eyes are not able to make distinctions of fine detail, though are perfectly capable of enabling these creatures to maneuver through space and locate the next warm ball of hydrogen to deposit a new egg.

## Lifecycle
Their lifecycle follows a simple pattern:
* A warm star is found.
* An egg is deposited in orbit.
* Dust, rock, and other matter collect around the egg to provide protection.
* The egg releases a relatively small amount of magic to catalyze the creation and propagation of life.
* Life becomes a self-sufficient system, growing and spreading across the "planet"/"egg".
* Upon a sufficient amount of natural life energy being cultivated, the creature absorbs all that energy to finalize its gestation where the shell of the egg cracks, and the creature swims off to find more warm stars which to lay its own eggs.

## Source of Magic
Celestial beasts are the source of life within the [[Prime Material Plane]] and as such they're also the [[Origins of Magic]] for Natural channeling. There is a lineage when casting natural magic that ties the conjurer to the living world. While it is unknown to them, this lineage is one that ties them to the yet-to-be-born beast on who's shell their world resides.
