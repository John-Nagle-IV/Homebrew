### Description
This place is one of pure will. To be here is to be at the hub of all creation, to be within the divine, and beyond even the outer realms of existence. No physical bodies can reside in this plane. To be in this plane and still be an individual entity is like being a droplet of water on the meniscus of the ocean.

### Visuals
There is no physical existence within this plane. Upon any thought, in immediate response, the person will experience the world shift around them until that thought is made manifest. Thoughts of explicit locations and people are projected in front of them and only visible to them. Without careful control of their will, they may find themselves being ricochet through the madness of their own reactions to the world they generate.

### Mechanics
#### Arrival
Upon arrival a **DC 18 Wisdom Save** must be made. Failure will cause the character to be unable to focus well enough to manifest a concept of "Self" to ground themselves in a realm of pure abstract thought. Their mind will begin to experience the infinite of creation across all dimensions and planes as it is integrated and dispersed. One more **DC 15 Wisdom Save** must be attempted. Upon success, they are cast back to their corporeal body. **Failure results in the death of the character** as their mind is completely integrated within the dimension. If they were expelled from this plane this way, their grasp on the world around them becomes unhinged. They can no longer communicate with those around them, and their movements become erratic. Only the [wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish) spell or the [greater restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/greater-restoration) cast with a 9th-level spell slot can end these effects. Once recovered, they will have full awareness of what they attempted, though any attempt to recollect what they saw or experienced will forever be stuck at the tip of their tongue, and the remainder of their days are plagued with a never-ending sense of de-ja-vu.

#### Movement
A player doesn't move. There is no "location" for them to move to. Thinking about where they want to be will immediately cause them to perceive the space around to fracture like a kaleidoscope with every shard reflecting the location in a different state and at a different time. A **DC 20 Wisdom Check** allows the shards to consolidate to a single clear image. Crafting this image and "willing a change" are interchangeable as all "changes" are just different "locations" to this realm.

#### Insertion
A player may insert themselves into the location they willed. Doing so requires a **DC 25 Wisdom Check** to fold their consciousness into that reality. This will extract them from Thought Space and put them into that concrete existence. Once there, normal rules apply. They gain full awareness of not only the life they lived up through their experiences in Thought Space, but the complete and totally separate life of the entity they folded into.
