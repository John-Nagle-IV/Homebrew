## The Founding
In the beginning there was the shapeless void of [[Thought Space]]. Then in an instant, well... as much as an instant can be defined as time had not yet been conceived, the existence that is [[Thought Space]] folded in unto itself to create the principal shapes which cradled what would become the "Planes of Existence"


## Known Planes of Existence
* [[Prime Material Plane]] - This is where the majority of the non-elemental, non-divine races originate. Much of what anyone knows is generally confined to this plane.
