## Magic Channels
There are a few fundamental foundations from which all magic is derived: Natural, Divine, and Arcane. While principally these sources all stem from manipulation and expression of a being's will that has some connection with [[Thought Space]], it is how we define this connection that we come to the naming of these fundamental channels.

Which channel power is drawn from holds no sway to the classifying schools of magic as schools were created by various magical societies to group effects and further help in the visualization component of spellcasting necessary to have one's will draw into effect though [[Thought Space]].

### Natural
Magic that is an innate component of life either through the catalyzing effects which spawned the initial life of the planet or the symbiotic nature [[Magical Creatures]] have with this source of energy. [[Celestial Beasts]] are the source of this magic as their lifecycle is what spawned the living world, and invocations through this channel are more done through instinct than a higher intelligence. Practitioners of this channel are: [Sorcerers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/sorcerer), [Druids](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/druid), [Monks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/monk), [Rangers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger), and [Bards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/bard).
### Divine
Wills that originate outside the [[Prime Material Plane]] while being able to be expressed within are attributed to the "Divine" channel. The [[Gods]], [[Patrons]] and other such entities fall within this category. These wills interact upon the world through either their champions, [Warlocks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/warlock), [Paladins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/paladin), and [Clerics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric) or by forming their own [[Avatars]]. Champions drawing power from their connection to these extraplanar wills are less expressing their own intent when casting and more so allowing themselves to be more deeply connected and influenced by the greater power.
### Arcane
While the Natural channel is drawing power from instinct and the Divine draws power from a will beyond the [[Prime Material Plane]], Arcane draws their power exclusively from understanding and implementing one's own intellect and will. Most recently discovered of the magics as well being the most versatile, scholars known as [Wizards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/wizard) and engineers known as [Artificer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/artificer) spend their time studying energies and how to manipulate them.
